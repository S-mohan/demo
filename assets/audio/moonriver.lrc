[00:03.000]Audrey Hepburn 
[00:09.300]Moon river, wider than a mile
[00:17.220]I’m crossing you in style some day
[00:25.290]Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
[00:35.040]Wherever you’re goin’
[00:39.530]i’m goin’ your way
[00:44.050]Two drifters, off to see the world
[00:52.270]There’s such a lot of world to see
[01:00.110]We’re after the same rainbow’s end,
[01:13.580]waitin’ round the bend
[01:18.980]My huckleberry friend
[01:24.930]moon river, and me
